## 🎮 Game Components

assets/script.js         → Utility functions (localStorage, access control)
assets/style.css         → All styling (responsive, gothic theme)
```

### Character Pages (12 Total - Copy Template to Add More)
```
character/artcollector.html    character/baker.html          character/clockmaker.html
character/dressmaker.html      character/explorer.html       character/fiduciary.html

## 🔧 How It Works - Architecture

### Character Selection Flow
```
User visits index.html
↓
Clicks character link (e.g., psychic.html)
↓
Page calls setCharacter('psychic')
↓
Stores 'psychic' in localStorage['characterName']
↓
Confirms role selection
↓
User clicks "Begin Investigation" to explore
```

### Vision Viewing Flow
```
User has character selected (stored in localStorage)
↓
User scans vision QR code → visits alice.html
↓
Page checks: getVisionAccessLevel(character, 'alice')
↓
Returns: 'FULL' (psychic) / 'PARTIAL' (baker) / 'BLOCKED' (others)
↓
Page increments counter: getNextVisionNumber('alice', 11)
↓
Shows appropriate vision text + number (1-11)
↓
Next scan shows vision 2, then 3, etc... up to 11, then loops to 1
```

---

## 💾 Data Storage

### localStorage Keys Used
```javascript
localStorage['characterName']           // Current character (e.g., 'psychic')
localStorage['vision_alice_number']     // Alice vision counter (1-11)
localStorage['vision_cordelia_number']  // Cordelia vision counter (1-11)
localStorage['vision_sebastian_number'] // Sebastian vision counter (1-11)
```

### Debug in Console
```javascript
// Check what's stored
console.log(localStorage)

// Get specific value
localStorage.getItem('characterName')

// Clear everything
localStorage.clear()

// Clear specific
localStorage.removeItem('vision_alice_number')
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette (Edit in `assets/style.css`)
```css
--primary-dark: #0a0a0a          /* Almost black */
--secondary-dark: #1a1a2e        /* Dark blue-black */
--accent-gold: #d4a574           /* 1920s gold */
--accent-purple: #4a148c         /* Deep purple */
--accent-cream: #f5f1e8          /* Light cream */
--text-light: #e0e0e0            /* Readable on dark */
```

### Responsive Design
```
Desktop (1200px+)    → Full layout, large text
Tablet (600-1200px) → Slightly smaller, adjusted padding
Mobile (<600px)     → Compact, mobile-optimized
Small Phone (<400px) → 2-column character grid
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Character Assignment
```
1. Visit /character/psychic.html
2. Should see confirmation
3. Check localStorage: should show 'psychic'
4. Reload page - still shows psychic
```

### Scenario 2: Vision Access Control
```
With Psychic selected:
1. Visit /clue/vision/alice.html → FULL detailed vision
2. Visit /clue/vision/alice.html again → Vision 2 (incremented)
3. Counter shows "Vision 2 of 11"

With Baker selected:
1. Clear localStorage
2. Visit /character/baker.html
3. Visit /clue/vision/alice.html → PARTIAL fragmented vision
4. Different text content

With Doctor selected:
1. Clear localStorage
2. Visit /character/doctor.html
3. Visit /clue/vision/alice.html → BLOCKED generic message
4. Shows: "You sense a cold presence..."
```

### Scenario 3: Vision Counter Reset
```
1. Set character to Psychic
2. Visit /clue/vision/alice.html 12 times
3. Should cycle: 1, 2, 3... 11, 12(→1), 2...
4. Visit /clue/vision/cordelia.html 3 times
5. Should show: 1, 2, 3 (independent counter)
```
