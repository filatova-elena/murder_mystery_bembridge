localStorage.getItem('vision_alice_number')  // Should show current vision
```

// Clear everything
localStorage.clear()

localStorage.removeItem('characterName')
localStorage.removeItem('vision_alice_number')
localStorage.removeItem('vision_cordelia_number')

## QR Code Setup

### Generating QR Codes

You can use any QR code generator. Create codes pointing to:

**Character Selection QR Codes:**
- Psychic: `https://your-domain.com/character/psychic.html`
- Baker: `https://your-domain.com/character/baker.html`
- (etc. for each character)

**Vision QR Codes (place around venue):**
- Alice: `https://your-domain.com/clue/vision/alice.html`
- Cordelia: `https://your-domain.com/clue/vision/cordelia.html`
- Sebastian: `https://your-domain.com/clue/vision/sebastian.html`

### Recommended QR Generators

### Physical Setup Tips
- Print QR codes on cardstock
- Laminate for durability
- Make them large enough to scan easily
- Test scanning with multiple phones/cameras

## Mobile Testing

### iPhone Safari
- QR Scanner built-in (Camera app)
- Tests from Notes app or Messages (tap link)
- Works great for this use case

### Android Chrome

- Tap lens icon and scan

### Test Devices
Test on at least one mobile device to ensure:
- Font sizes are readable
- Buttons are easily tapable (min 44x44px - already satisfied)
- Colors display correctly
- Layout is responsive

## Customization Tips

### Change the Mystery Title
Edit in `index.html`:
```html

```css
:root {
  --accent-gold: #d4a574;  /* Change this */
  --accent-purple: #4a148c;  /* Or this */
  /* etc. */
}
```

### Add New Characters
1. Create `character/newcharacter.html`
2. Copy from `character/baker.html`

4. Add link in `index.html` character grid
5. Update `script.js` access levels if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Character not persisting after page reload
**Solution**: Check browser privacy settings. If in private/incognito mode, localStorage may be restricted.

### Issue: Vision counter not incrementing
**Solution**: Make sure you're using the same browser/device. Each device has separate localStorage.

### Issue: CSS styling not showing
**Solution**: Check file paths. Ensure you're running through a server (not `file://`).

### Issue: QR code links not working
**Solution**: Use full URLs with domain, not relative paths. Test links manually first.

### Issue: Mobile responsiveness issues
**Solution**: 
- Test in multiple browsers
- Check DevTools device emulation (F12 → Device Toolbar)
- Verify meta viewport tag is present

```
