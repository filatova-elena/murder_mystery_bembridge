      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You wear ascots, use cigarette holders, and lecture about everything. Horrified by mess and disorder. You speak with affected sophistication about art, beauty, and taste.</p>
      <p>Behind the polished exterior lies a secret: you come from a family that fell from grace—the notorious Romano mob family. You've rebuilt the family fortune through legitimate art dealing (mostly), but you can't quite escape your roots. One foot in legitimacy, one in the shadows.</p>

      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>Your family name carries weight in Long Beach—but not the kind you'd prefer. Your great-great-grandfather was <strong>Frankie "the Coast" Romano</strong>, the notorious rum runner who controlled bootlegging operations at the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition.</p>
      <p>The Romano family had it all in the 1920s-1950s: money, power, connections, glamour. Nightclubs, Hollywood parties, political influence. But then came the IRS investigations in the 1960s-1980s. The government seized everything.</p>
      <p>But there are rumors—whispers in the family about hidden wealth that escaped the IRS. The legendary <strong>"Romano Treasure."</strong> Is it real? Or just a desperate family myth?</p>
      <p>You learned the art world through necessity—selling salvaged family pieces to survive. But you discovered you actually had talent for it. You've built a legitimate art dealing business and made real money again. Though you still dabble in questionable provenance and black market connections when profitable. Old habits die hard.</p>
      <p>You kept the ornate glass bottle as a proud family heirloom—it's beautiful, mysterious, and one of the few things that survived the family's downfall.</p>
      <p>When you heard about the investigation at the old Montrose mansion—where your ancestor Frankie did business in the 1920s—you couldn't resist. Maybe the treasure is real. Maybe it's here.</p>

      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Find the legendary Romano treasure. Hidden wealth that escaped the IRS. Could it be here in the mansion?</li>
        <li>Discover the truth about the glass bottle. Where did it come from? What was it used for? Why did Frankie keep it?</li>
        <li>Understand your family's connection to the 1925 deaths. Three people died in October 1925. Are these connected? What role did Frankie play?</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Useful Allies</h2>
      <p><strong>The Explorer:</strong> They're ALSO searching for "Romano treasure." Are you rivals or allies? Do you share information or compete?</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They manage old estates. Might have information about business dealings between the Romanos and other families. Do they know where assets were hidden?</p>
      <p><strong>The Town Doctor:</strong> You heard rumors that your ancestor did business with a doctor or pharmacist back in the 1920s. Could they know anything about that?</p>
      <p><strong>The Botany Professor:</strong> The Romano operation imported exotic goods. Could they identify what your family was smuggling?</p>
