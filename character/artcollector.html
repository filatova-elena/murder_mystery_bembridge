    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Pretentious aesthete obsessed with artistic merit and provenance. One foot in legitimacy, one in the shadows.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>Your family name carries weight in Long Beach—but not the kind you'd prefer. Your great-great-grandfather was <strong>Frankie "the Coast" Romano</strong>, the notorious rum runner who controlled bootlegging operations at the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition.</p>
      <p>The Romano family had it all in the 1920s-1950s: money, power, connections, glamour. Nightclubs, Hollywood parties, political influence. But then came the IRS investigations in the 1960s-1980s. The government seized everything.</p>
      <p>But there are rumors—whispers in the family about hidden wealth that escaped the IRS. The legendary <strong>"Romano Treasure."</strong> Is it real? Or just a desperate family myth?</p>
      <p>You learned the art world through necessity—selling salvaged family pieces to survive. But you discovered you actually had talent for it. You've built a legitimate art dealing business and made real money again. Though you still dabble in questionable provenance and black market connections when profitable. Old habits die hard.</p>
      <p>You kept the ornate glass bottle as a proud family heirloom—it's beautiful, mysterious, and one of the few things that survived the family's downfall.</p>
      <p>When you heard about the investigation at the old Montrose mansion—where your ancestor Frankie did business in the 1920s—you couldn't resist. Maybe the treasure is real. Maybe it's here.</p>

      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover the dark truth behind the three spirits bound to this mansion—The Lonely Ghost, The Heartbroken Ghost, and The Cursed Alchemist Ghost.</li>
        <li><strong>Private (optional):</strong> Discover the location of the legendary Romano treasure hidden within these walls.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>Your knowledge of the Romano family gives you complete understanding of their smuggling operations. Your Basic History skill helps with art authentication and provenance. Your family knowledge is key—others' exploration and estate records can help locate what you're seeking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Explorer:</strong> They're also searching for the Romano treasure. Share information—your family knowledge combined with their exploration skills could help locate what you're both seeking.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They manage old estates and have information about business dealings between the Romanos and other families. Their records could help identify where assets might have been hidden.</p>
      <p><strong>The Town Doctor:</strong> You heard rumors that your ancestor did business with a doctor or pharmacist back in the 1920s. Their family records might reveal those business connections.</p>
      <p><strong>The Botany Professor:</strong> The Romano operation imported exotic goods. They can identify what your family was smuggling and help you understand the full scope of the operation.</p>
