      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You bring comfort food for everyone. Observant but kind. You're an orphan with a dark secret: an old diary is your only connection to ancestors you never met. You have a gift for measurements and proportions—everything you bake turns out perfect, like it's in your blood.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you know things before they happen. Sometimes you sense presences others can't. You've always been a little different that way.</p>

      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're an orphan. You never knew your parents or where you truly came from. All you have is an old diary—worn, fragile, precious—that somehow ended up with you.</p>
      <p>The diary was written by someone named <strong>Eleanor</strong>. She writes about being adopted, about not knowing her real parents. She writes about searching for identity, for belonging. You don't know if Eleanor was your grandmother, great-grandmother, or some other relative. But her words speak to you across the generations.</p>
      <p>The diary contains a bread recipe—"my grandmother bread recipe," Eleanor calls it. You've been baking this bread your whole life. It is why you chose to be a baker, to feel closer to your family even if you never knew who they were.</p>
      <p>Recently, you've started having strange feelings. Dreams. The face of a beautiful woman with a pearl necklace calling to you. A sense that you're connected to something bigger than yourself.</p>
      <p>When you heard about the investigation at the old Montrose mansion, something drew you here. You don't know why, but you feel like you <em>need</em> to be here.</p>
