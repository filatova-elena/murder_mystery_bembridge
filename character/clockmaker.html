      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Talks a mile a minute while your hands are always tinkering. You interrupt yourself mid-sentence: "Wait, what was I—OH! The springs!" You see the world as one giant clock that's slightly out of sync.</p>
      <p>Caffeine-fueled chaos. Sleep? Never heard of her. Covered in tiny gears and oil stains. You're obsessed with timing, synchronicity, astronomical alignments. Everything happens at the right time for a reason—if you can just figure out the pattern.</p>
      <p><strong>Current project:</strong> Building a helmet that explores the intersection of neuroscience and mystical experience. The Influencer thinks you're wasting your time proving pseudoscience. You think they're missing the entire point.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p><strong>⭐ Expert:</strong> history</p>
      <p><strong>📖 Basic:</strong> spiritual</p>

      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a clockmaker and horologist—obsessed with time, timing, and the mechanisms that measure it. But you're not just about clocks. You study astronomical timing, consciousness, synchronicities. You believe the universe has patterns, that timing matters, that mystical experiences are real phenomena we're only beginning to measure.</p>
      <p>For years, you've been obsessing over an antique pocket watch from 1925. You inherited it, been trying to fix/restore it, studying every detail. Inside, you discovered an engraving: <strong>September 4th</strong> and astronomical symbols you recognized immediately—the <strong>Jupiter-Venus conjunction.</strong></p>
      <p>You calculated it. <strong>September 4, 1925, at 6:14 AM.</strong> A rare conjunction that happens once in decades. Someone thought this date was important enough to engrave it permanently.</p>
      <p>The Influencer featured you and your pocket watch in their "Long Beach Urban Legends" series. You explained the conjunction, the timing, the mystery. They were skeptical (as always—they think your helmet project is pseudoscience too). But the episode led you both here, to this mansion, to <strong>October 1925 deaths</strong> that happened exactly five weeks after that sacred conjunction.</p>
      <p>This can't be a coincidence. The universe doesn't work that way.</p>

      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover who owned the pocket watch. Someone engraved September 4th and the conjunction symbols. Who? Why was this date so important? How did you end up with their watch?</li>
        <li>Understand the significance of September 4, 1925. The Jupiter-Venus conjunction occurred at 6:14 AM. What happened on this date? Was the timing used deliberately for something?</li>
        <li>Piece together what the timeline reveals. The sequence of deaths is the key to understanding what really happened.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You're uniquely positioned to understand temporal patterns and celestial significance. You can:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Spot chronological inconsistencies in death records and timelines</li>
        <li>Connect astronomical events to earthly occurrences</li>
        <li>Authenticate and interpret the pocket watch</li>
        <li>Calculate significant dates and their astrological meanings</li>
        <li>Identify when events happened in precise sequence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also decide: are you seeing real patterns, or connecting random dots because your brain wants to find meaning?</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Influencer:</strong> Your friend/collaborator who featured you in their "Long Beach Mysteries" series. You came here together. They think your helmet project is pseudoscience and everything has a rational explanation. You argue about whether mysticism is real or just neuroscience. They're filming everything while you're trying to investigate sacred timing.</p>
      <p><strong>The Psychic Medium:</strong> They understand the mystical significance of timing and alignments. Finally, someone who gets it! What does the conjunction mean spiritually?</p>
      <p><strong>The Baker:</strong> They're friends with the Influencer. Something about their presence feels synchronistic. Like they're meant to be here at this exact time. The universe brought you together for a reason.</p>
