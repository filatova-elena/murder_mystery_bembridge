      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>Your family name is <strong>Sinclair,</strong> but it wasn't always. You eventually discovered that your family changed their name in the 1960s for political reasons—your ancestors were the <strong>Crane family</strong> of Long Beach.</p>
      <p>You knew you descended from <strong>Dr. Thaddeus Crane,</strong> a respectable town doctor from the 1920s. That's ALL you knew—the family buried everything else.</p>
      <p>Recently, you received a mysterious box from the Fiduciary containing old estate papers. Inside, you discover something shocking: <strong>Dr. Thaddeus Crane had a brother you've never heard about!</strong></p>
      <p>As you pursue the information in the box, you wonder about your family's dark past. You're also left to grapple with difficult questions: Why now? What does the Fiduciary know? What game are they playing?</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Understand the role of Dr. Thaddeus Crane. What role did he play? Could he have been involved in something criminal? Was he a victim or a perpetrator?</li>
        <li>Who is the ghost of The Alchemist? People say The Alchemist is cursed. What was the curse and who cursed him?</li>
        <li>Uncover the secret formula. Sporadic notes mention a chemical formula… What was it and how was it used?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You're uniquely positioned to understand the medical and pharmaceutical aspects of this mystery. You can:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Interpret medical formulas and understand what they would actually do</li>
        <li>Read medical records and death certificates with professional expertise</li>
        <li>Determine whether deaths were natural or suspicious</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also grapple with difficult questions about the role your own family played in the scandal. <strong>Choose wisely how to use your clues.</strong></p>
