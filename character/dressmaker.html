      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Obsessive, artistic perfectionist covered in pins and measuring tape. You can't stop adjusting hems and measuring people with your eyes. Fixated on the tragedy of the bride who never wore her dress: <strong>Cordelia Montrose.</strong></p>
      <p>You kept the wedding dress—saved it, preserved it, displayed it because it's hauntingly beautiful. Your fixation seems... unhealthy. You speak about Cordelia like you knew her, even though she died 100 years ago. But in a way, through your ancestor's love letters and journals, you feel like you do know her.</p>

      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're descended from <strong>Elias Monroe,</strong> the dressmaker who created <strong>Cordelia Montrose's</strong> wedding dress in 1925. The dress that was never worn. The bride who never made it to the altar.</p>
      <p>Your family has preserved everything from Elias's workshop—his tools, his sketches, his correspondence. But most importantly: the dress itself. White silk, delicate lace, perfect in every detail. A masterpiece that was never worn.</p>
      <p><strong>Elias was in love with Cordelia.</strong> Everyone in your family knows this story. He sent her flowers, wrote her poems, and begged her not to marry <strong>Sebastian Crane.</strong> Yes, not everyone knows who Cordelia was engaged to. Few people even remember that name: Sebastian Crane. It's as if he was erased from history.</p>
      <p>But you grew up with this story. You grew up with the dress. You can't stop thinking about Cordelia—the romantic, tragic bride. You preserve her dress like a shrine. You research her life, her death, what could have been.</p>
      <p>Some people say your fixation is unhealthy. Maybe they're right. But you need to know the truth. <em>What happened to Cordelia? Why did she die?</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover what really happened to Cordelia. She died in October 1925, supposedly of a broken heart. But you don't believe it. What was the true cause?</li>
        <li>Learn why Cordelia rejected Elias. Your ancestor loved her truly, genuinely. He would have cherished her. Why did she choose Sebastian instead? What did she see in him?</li>
        <li>Uncover Cordelia's secret. In early 1925, Cordelia disappeared for months, then returned changed—distant. Her best friend Alice even complained to Elias that she hadn't seen Cordelia for weeks. Why did she disappear?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You're uniquely positioned to understand Cordelia's personal life through your ancestor's perspective. You can:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Analyze the dress for clues and alterations</li>
        <li>Use Elias's journal and letters to understand Cordelia's mindset</li>
        <li>Connect personal details from family records to larger events</li>
        <li>Identify Montrose family items and their significance</li>
        <li>Question who knew Cordelia best and what they observed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also confront the uncomfortable truth: Did your ancestor's obsession with Cordelia cloud his judgment? What don't you know about Sebastian or Cordelia's true feelings?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Heiress:</strong> She lives in the Montrose mansion. She might have other items that belonged to Cordelia. Will she let you see them? Could she help you understand the mansion's history?</p>
      <p><strong>The Town Doctor:</strong> You know Sebastian Crane was a pharmacist, and his brother—the Town Doctor—was a physician! Would they have any information on the Crane family? Did they know about the engagement?</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They have records about the Montrose family and the engagement. They might know why Cordelia chose Sebastian over Elias. They might also know what really happened to Cordelia.</p>
      <p><strong>The Baker:</strong> Their ancestor knew Cordelia's best friend, Alice Whitmore! They might have family stories or records that could shed light on Cordelia's disappearance and what changed her.</p>
