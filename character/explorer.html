      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Rugged adventurer hunting treasure. Something about this place feels strangely familiar.</p>

      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a treasure hunter and explorer—some call you an archaeologist, others call you a scavenger. You prefer "historical recovery specialist." You chase legends, track down lost artifacts, and search for hidden wealth.</p>
      <p>You've been researching the <strong>Romano family</strong> for months. Frankie "the Coast" Romano controlled bootlegging operations at Long Beach harbor during Prohibition. The family made millions. Then the IRS seized everything in the 1960s-1980s.</p>
      <p>But the numbers don't add up. The IRS recovered less than the Romano family supposedly had. Where did the rest go? The legendary <strong>"Romano Treasure"</strong>—cash, contraband, valuable goods hidden before the government came knocking.</p>
      <p>Your research led you to the old Montrose mansion. Frankie did business here in the 1920s. You heard there was a connection to the Montroses. The property has been abandoned for decades. If the treasure exists, it could be hidden here.</p>
      <p>Now you're here, and something feels... familiar. Like you're meant to be here. But that's ridiculous. Your family name is Whitmore—it's common enough. What connections could there be? You're here for the treasure. Nothing more.</p>
      <p><em>Or are you?</em></p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover the dark truth behind the three spirits bound to this mansion—The Lonely Ghost, The Heartbroken Ghost, and The Cursed Alchemist Ghost.</li>
        <li><strong>Private (optional):</strong> Discover the location of the legendary Romano treasure hidden within these walls.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>Your knowledge of Alice Whitmore gives you understanding of her connections and legacy. Your Basic History skill helps with map reading and artifact evaluation. What you find needs context—others can help interpret the significance of your discoveries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Art Collector:</strong> They're also looking for the Romano treasure (it's their family fortune). Combine your resources—their family connections and your exploration skills could help locate what you're both seeking.</p>
      <p><strong>The Botany Professor:</strong> You're friends who complement each other. They're brilliant and theoretical, you're practical and action-oriented. Your different approaches help solve complex problems when you combine forces.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They have estate records and property documents. They can help identify where valuable items were hidden or stored. They might also have records about old Long Beach families like the Whitmores.</p>
      <p><strong>The Baker:</strong> Something about them feels familiar. There might be a connection you both need to explore. Share your observations—together you might understand the link.</p>
