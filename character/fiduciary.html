      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Pedantic, detail-oriented record-keeper obsessed with proper documentation and estate management. You know where all the records are, though you haven't always read them thoroughly. Usually found in the Fiduciary's Office, surrounded by files and ledgers.</p>
      <p><strong>Your Secret Hobby:</strong> You collect poisonous spiders and snakes. You're an expert in toxicology, though few people know this about you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p><strong>⭐ Expert:</strong> legal</p>
      <p><strong>📖 Basic:</strong> medical</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You work for a generational wealth management firm that has managed the estates of the <strong>Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore families</strong> for decades. These properties have been a professional frustration—the haunted mansion has been an eyesore and wasted asset for generations.</p>
      <p>While researching the Montrose estate, you traced the lineage to find the Heiress and contacted her about the unclaimed property. You hoped she'd take possession and finally do something with it.</p>
      <p>During your research, you discovered records about the <strong>Crane family name change</strong>—they became the Sinclairs in the 1960s, apparently for political reasons. You found a box of old papers connecting Dr. Thaddeus Crane to a brother named <strong>Sebastian Crane.</strong> You've never heard of Sebastian Crane, and you've been managing the estates for years! You sent this box to Dr. Sinclair, curious about their reaction.</p>
      <p>Now you've noticed some <strong>disturbing inconsistencies in death records from 1925,</strong> and you're determined to finally understand what happened. You've heard rumors about the ghosts haunting the mansion, and you can't shake off a strange feeling.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover who paid the Mortician. Follow the money—who bribed the Mortician to cover something up in 1925?</li>
        <li>Determine the true heir to the Montrose estate. The Heiress is a distant relative, but is she the true heir?</li>
        <li>Who was Sebastian Crane? The records are incomplete and mysterious—as if someone tried to erase him from existence completely.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You control access to official records and can decide how to use this power:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Share documents openly or keep them to yourself</li>
        <li>Read everything thoroughly or only what's necessary for your job</li>
        <li>Reveal information freely or strategically withhold it</li>
        <li>Collaborate with others or investigate independently</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The choice is yours:</strong> Will you be the helpful guide or the secretive gatekeeper?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Heiress:</strong> You found her and gave her the Montrose mansion. But is she really the true heir? Or is there someone else?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Sinclair (Doctor):</strong> You sent them the mysterious box about Sebastian Crane. How will they react? What do they know?</p>
      <p><strong>The Mortician:</strong> Payment records show someone paid them in October 1925. Were they part of a cover-up?</p>
      <p><strong>The Art Collector:</strong> Their family records might connect to the Crane family business dealings. Could the Romanos and Cranes have worked together?</p>
