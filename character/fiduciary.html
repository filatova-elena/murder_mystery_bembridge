      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You work for a generational wealth management firm that has managed the estates of the <strong>Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore families</strong> for decades. These properties have been a professional frustration—the haunted mansion has been an eyesore and wasted asset for generations.</p>
      <p>While researching the Montrose estate, you traced the lineage to find the Heiress and contacted her about the unclaimed property. You hoped she'd take possession and finally do something with it.</p>
      <p>During your research, you discovered records about the <strong>Crane family name change</strong>—they became the Sinclairs in the 1960s, apparently for political reasons. You found a box of old papers connecting Dr. Thaddeus Crane to a brother named <strong>Sebastian Crane.</strong> You've never heard of Sebastian Crane, and you've been managing the estates for years! You sent this box to Dr. Sinclair, curious about their reaction.</p>
      <p>Now you've noticed some <strong>disturbing inconsistencies in death records from 1925,</strong> and you're determined to finally understand what happened. You've heard rumors about the ghosts haunting the mansion, and you can't shake off a strange feeling.</p>
