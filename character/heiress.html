      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Wealthy, dramatic socialite dripping in jewels. You complain constantly, love drama, but there's intelligence beneath the act. You're sharper than you appear.</p>
      <p>You wanted independence from your overbearing family. You thought claiming the old Montrose mansion would be glamorous. You were wrong. It's very, very haunted. You're genuinely scared, but too proud to admit you made a mistake and move back.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p><strong>⭐ Expert:</strong> rumors, personal_montrose</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a distant relative of the Montrose family—the mansion came to you through a complicated inheritance chain. Your family isn't particularly close; you barely knew about this Long Beach property until the Fiduciary tracked you down and informed you that you'd inherited it.</p>
      <p>At first, you were thrilled. A mansion! Your own place! Independence from your annoying family! You moved in immediately, thinking it would be a glamorous fresh start.</p>
      <p>Then you realized: <strong>it's haunted. Very haunted.</strong></p>
      <p>Doors open by themselves. You hear footsteps. Cold spots in certain rooms. Sometimes you see figures in 1920s clothing. One room in particular—you refuse to go in there anymore. Something terrible happened in that room.</p>
      <p>You're scared, but also too proud to admit you made a mistake and move back. So you hired <strong>Margo Laveau, the psychic medium,</strong> to "deal with it."</p>
      <p>Now all these people have shown up to investigate. Part of you is relieved (safety in numbers), part of you is annoyed (this is YOUR house), and part of you is terrified of what they might discover.</p>
      <p><em>What happened in your mansion 100 years ago? And why won't the ghosts leave you alone?</em></p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover what happened in your mansion. Three ghosts haunt this place. Who were they? What happened to them? Why did they die here?</li>
        <li>Uncover the truth about the Montrose family's dirty deeds. Despite being respected and influential, the Montroses have a dark reputation.</li>
        <li>Collect as much gossip as possible without losing your mind. You love to gossip, but all these people have their own objectives in YOUR house!</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Psychic Medium:</strong> You hired them to get rid of the ghosts. Now they're talking about "helping spirits find peace" and "unfinished business." You just want to sleep without seeing dead people.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They found you and gave you this mansion. Do they know more than they told you? Why did they really want you to take possession of this property?</p>
      <p><strong>The Baker:</strong> Something about them feels important or familiar. Have you observed a distinctive Montrose nose? Could they have a connection to the Montrose family?</p>
