      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Documents everything for content. "Wait, let me film this!" You treat tragedy as an engagement opportunity. Designer clothes meet chaotic energy.</p>
      <p>You have a rational explanation for everything—ghosts are psychological phenomena, psychic abilities are pattern recognition, mystical experiences are just neuroscience. You keep telling the Clockmaker their helmet project is pseudoscience.</p>
      <p>You're here because this investigation is PERFECT for your "Long Beach Urban Legends & Mysteries" series. Three deaths, a haunted mansion, hidden secrets? This is content gold.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You run a popular series called <strong>"Long Beach Urban Legends & Mysteries"</strong> covering local history, unsolved cases, and supernatural claims (which you approach skeptically). You've done episodes on:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>The Haunted Montrose Mansion—ghostly sightings, rumors of tragedy</li>
        <li>The Mysterious Sullivan Bakery Fire—suspicious 1990s fire that destroyed a generations-old bakery</li>
        <li>The Romano Treasure Legend—mob family wealth that supposedly escaped the IRS</li>
        <li>Cursed Objects & Fatal Timing—featured your friend the Clockmaker and their mysterious pocket watch</li>
        <li>The Vanishing Bride—a wealthy woman who disappeared in 1925 then died mysteriously</li>
        <li>Long Beach Harbor Ghosts—bootleggers and smugglers at the Port</li>
        <li>The Psychic Sisters—the famous Laveau family and 1920s spiritualism</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Your latest research:</strong> Three mysterious deaths in October 1925. All at the same mansion. All within 11 days. And nobody talks about it.</p>
      <p>When you heard about this investigation at the Montrose mansion, you knew you had to be here. You brought the Clockmaker (who's obsessed with the timing). You're friends with the Baker (featured their bakery on your food channel).</p>
      <p>This is going to be your best episode yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Create the ultimate episode. Document everything. Get the footage. Uncover the truth. This investigation could make your series blow up.</li>
        <li>Prove everything has a rational explanation. Ghosts, psychics, mystical timing—you're convinced it's all psychology, coincidence, and pattern-seeking behavior. Can you debunk the supernatural claims while solving the mystery?</li>
        <li>Connect the dots between your episodes. You've covered the mansion, the fire, the treasure, the deaths—separately. But what if they're all connected? What if all these "urban legends" are pieces of one true story?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You're uniquely positioned to connect seemingly disparate events through your research archive. You can:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Access all your previous research and episodes</li>
        <li>Spot connections between the Sullivan fire, Romano treasure, and 1925 deaths</li>
        <li>Document everything (hopefully capturing accidental evidence)</li>
        <li>Apply skeptical analysis to debunk supernatural explanations</li>
        <li>Interview other investigators and record their insights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you must also consider: what if you're wrong? What if some things can't be explained rationally?</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Clockmaker:</strong> You featured them in your series. They're obsessed with that pocket watch and mystical timing. You brought them here, even though you think their helmet project is pseudoscience. You argue constantly but need each other.</p>
      <p><strong>The Baker:</strong> You featured their bakery on your food channel. You're friends. You researched the Sullivan bakery fire for your mysteries series—you might be able to help them understand what happened to their family.</p>
      <p><strong>The Psychic Medium:</strong> You covered the Laveau family psychics in an episode. You're skeptical of their abilities but they make good content. Are they genuine or performing?</p>
      <p><strong>Others:</strong> Your documentation skills make you valuable, but your "everything for content" attitude might annoy people. Also, you might have accidentally filmed crucial evidence without realizing it.</p>
