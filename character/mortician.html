      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Unnervingly calm about death. You speak in hushed funeral tones and discuss decomposition over tea. "My condolences" for everything. You never remove your black gloves. You examine people like future clients.</p>
      <p>People often don't realize when you are silently standing behind them and jump when they see you. There's something unsettling about your presence—but perhaps that's appropriate for someone who spends their days with the dead.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p><strong>⭐ Expert:</strong> medical</p>
      <p><strong>📖 Basic:</strong> legal</p>

      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>Your family has run the mortuary in Long Beach for over 100 years. Your ancestor, <strong>Silas Blackwell,</strong> handled the bodies of everyone who died in this town during the 1920s.</p>
      <p>Including three very important deaths in <strong>October 1925:</strong> Alice Whitmore, Sebastian Crane, and Cordelia Montrose. All within eleven days. So it's not hard for you to match the <strong>ghosts haunting the mansion</strong> with their real names.</p>
      <p>But the real question is: should you share that information? While people debate and blab, you can perform your own REAL investigation.</p>
      <p>And you have your first clue. Recently you found a record that someone paid <strong>Silas Blackwell $500 in 1925</strong>—a fortune at the time—with instructions to ask no questions and alter no records.</p>
      <p>But Silas kept his own private observations. He wrote down what he really saw. He documented the inconsistencies. And he hid those notes in the family archives.</p>
      <p>Now you have them. And you know something was covered up.</p>

      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover who paid the bribe. Someone gave Silas $500 to keep quiet. Was it Dr. Thaddeus Crane? The Montrose family? Follow the money.</li>
        <li>Understand what Silas covered up. Your ancestor's notes mention discrepancies in all three deaths. What did he see? What didn't match?</li>
        <li>Determine the true causes of death. Official records say accident, homicide, and natural causes. But Silas's notes suggest otherwise. What really killed these three people?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Key Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>The Town Doctor:</strong> They're descended from Dr. Thaddeus Crane, who signed all three death certificates. Did their ancestor pay the bribe? Are they complicit in the cover-up? Or did they also discover the truth?</p>
      <p><strong>The Fiduciary:</strong> They have financial records and estate documents. They might know who authorized the $500 payment in 1925. Have they already discovered this too?</p>
      <p><strong>The Botany Professor:</strong> Your notes mention symptoms and substances. They might be able to identify what poisons or toxins were involved in Sebastian's death.</p>
