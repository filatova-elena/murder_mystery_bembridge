      <p>You have been assigned the role of:</p>
      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">A Local Resident</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>You're an ordinary resident of Long Beach who's been around long enough to know the town's dark history, scandals, and whispers that echo through the streets. You know people, stories, and what the townsfolk say about the Montroses, the Romanos, and the tragedies that have touched this place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You're a lifelong resident of Long Beach. You've watched the town grow, watched families rise and fall, seen scandals that were quietly buried. You go to the same shops, the same cafés, attend the same churches as everyone else. You hear the gossip. You know the rumors.</p>
      <p>When you heard about the investigation into the old Montrose mansion mysteries, you were curious—like everyone. But unlike the official investigators, you know the town's informal history. The stories people tell when they think no one's listening.</p>
      <p>You don't have special abilities or secrets of your own. But you have something valuable: you know what people say. And sometimes, what people say is closer to the truth than official records.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover the dark truth behind the three spirits bound to this mansion—The Lonely Ghost, The Heartbroken Ghost, and The Cursed Alchemist Ghost.</li>
        <li><strong>Private (optional):</strong> Separate the dark truth from the web of town gossip.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>You have access to town gossip and local stories that official records miss. Your knowledge of social dynamics helps you identify contradictions. Share what you know—others can help verify rumors against hard evidence.</p>
