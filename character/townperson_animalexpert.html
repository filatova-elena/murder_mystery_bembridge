      <p>You have been assigned the role of:</p>
      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">Townperson Animal Expert</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Eccentric naturalist with an unshakeable connection to the animal world—flamboyant, unpredictable, and utterly confident in your unique perspective. While others see clues in documents and crime scenes, you see them in animal behavior, and when you put your mind to it, you're sharper than any so-called expert.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Animal Communication:</strong> You have an uncanny ability to read animal behavior and understand what animals are trying to tell you. Birds, dogs, insects—they all communicate in their own language, and you speak it fluently.</p>
      <p><strong>Natural Observation:</strong> Your keen eye for animal behavior translates into noticing details in environments others overlook. Disturbed earth, missing wildlife, unusual animal activity patterns—these tell stories.</p>
      <p><strong>Eccentric Genius:</strong> Your unconventional thinking leads to creative solutions and unexpected connections. You see patterns others miss because you think completely differently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You've always been different. While other children played with toys, you bonded with creatures. As you grew older, your gift—for that's what it is—became undeniable. You understand animals in ways that seem impossible to other people. You've tracked missing people through the woods using nothing but animal signs. You've identified poisonings by observing insect and bird behavior around contaminated areas.</p>
      <p>When the Montrose mansion deaths occurred, you were there—not at the mansion itself, but in the surrounding woods and gardens. You noticed that the birds had abandoned the area. All of them, gone. The mice avoided certain paths. The very creatures that should have been present were absent or acting strangely.</p>
      <p>You've been trying to tell people this for years. Nobody listened. Now, with a proper investigation underway, maybe they finally will.</p>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover the dark truth behind the three spirits bound to this mansion—The Lonely Ghost, The Heartbroken Ghost, and The Cursed Alchemist Ghost.</li>
        <li><strong>Private (optional):</strong> Uncover what the animals witnessed and what their silence reveals.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>Your animal communication ability reveals clues about timing, location, and toxins through animal behavior. Your natural observation skills notice environmental details others miss. Share what the animals tell you—others can help interpret these clues in context.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Notes for Play</h2>
      <p>You communicate with animals in ways that seem magical but are rooted in careful observation and deep understanding. When you interact with the natural world, you're not guessing—you're reading signs that are absolutely clear to someone with your gifts.</p>
      <p>Your strength is your ability to think outside the box and notice what everyone else has trained themselves to ignore. Sometimes the most important clues are the ones hidden in plain sight—or rather, hidden in the behavior of birds, the absence of insects, or the path a frightened animal won't cross.</p>
