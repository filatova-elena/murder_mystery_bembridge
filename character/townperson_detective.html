      <p>You have been assigned the role of:</p>
      <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">Townperson Detective</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Sharp-eyed investigator and fedora-wearing skeptic who trusts evidence over authority—years of investigating small-town mysteries have made you sharp, cautious, and quietly relentless. You don't believe in coincidences and you're convinced that the official story about the deaths at the Montrose mansion doesn't add up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Keen Eye for Detail:</strong> You notice things others overlook—contradictions, inconsistencies, tiny details that don't fit the narrative. Crime scene analysis is second nature to you.</p>
      <p><strong>Investigative Network:</strong> Years of investigation have given you connections throughout town. You can find information, trace leads, and access records others can't reach.</p>
      <p><strong>Skeptical Analysis:</strong> You're trained to see through lies and spin. Official statements don't fool you. You can identify when someone is being evasive or when a story has holes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Background</h2>
      <p>You've spent years as a small-town investigator—not quite a cop, not quite a private detective, but someone the locals call when things don't add up. You've built a reputation for being thorough, relentless, and immune to pressure.</p>
      <p>The three deaths at the Montrose mansion in October 1925—ruled as accidents, suicides, poisonings—struck you as suspiciously convenient. Three deaths, three different circumstances, all resolved quickly and neatly. Too neat.</p>
      <p>When the call came for civilians to help investigate, you volunteered immediately. This is your chance to dig into a case you've always suspected was badly handled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Objectives</h2>
      <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Discover the dark truth behind the three spirits bound to this mansion—The Lonely Ghost, The Heartbroken Ghost, and The Cursed Alchemist Ghost.</li>
        <li><strong>Private (optional):</strong> Uncover whether the three deaths were truly accidents or something far more sinister.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
      <p>Your investigative network gives you access to records others can't reach. Your crime scene analysis skills help you spot contradictions in official stories. Share your findings—others' knowledge can help verify your suspicions and fill in gaps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
      <h2>Notes for Play</h2>
      <p>You have no supernatural abilities. You're a skeptic who believes in evidence. Use your investigative skills to separate fact from fiction. Question everything. Trust no one completely until the evidence proves them trustworthy.</p>
      <p>Your strength is in your ability to see the bigger picture—how the pieces fit together, where the gaps are, what doesn't add up.</p>
