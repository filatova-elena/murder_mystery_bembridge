  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "The craftsmanship suggests South American origin, possibly Peruvian or Colombian work from the early 20th century. The hand-thrown purple clay and deliberate gold detailing indicate a skilled artisan. The base is unusually weighted—suggesting a hidden compartment. Someone commissioned or acquired this piece for a specific purpose. It's referenced repeatedly in the Ray Turner book annotations—Turner must have understood its significance.",
    "explorer": "This vase contained the rose garden map. Now find out what else it held. Check: 1) The Ray Turner book for specific annotations about this vase—they contain coded information about its contents, 2) Correspondence about commissioning South American pottery, 3) any records of vase repairs or restoration (that's when compartments are accessed). Ray Turner documented smuggling operations—his annotations about 'vessels' and 'containment' are literal. This vase was a smuggling artifact. The hidden compartment once held more than just a map."
