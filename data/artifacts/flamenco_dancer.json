  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "A Spanish masterpiece from the 1880s. The artist captured energy, passion, and human emotion in a single moment. The red dress practically glows with life. The facial expression shows concentration and grace. This is masterwork-level painting—one of three significant pieces in the Romano family collection. Historical records show this eventually entered the Getty Museum collection as part of a 1926 Montrose family donation.",
    "explorer": "Spanish origin connects to Mediterranean smuggling routes through Long Beach harbor. The 1926 Getty donation is suspicious—why donate suddenly after 1925? Check for: 1) Getty Museum records of the 1926 Montrose donation, 2) Any cash flow or financial distress in 1926, 3) Insurance claims or valuations before/after the donation. This painting was likely liquidated or transferred to cover tracks. The timing suggests this art was connected to the 1925 deaths and required disposal."
