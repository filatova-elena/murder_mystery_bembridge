  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "The craftsmanship is excellent, but the style appears to be a skilled 1940s reproduction rather than authentic Ming Dynasty. However, the weight distribution suggests something was deliberately hidden. The base has a hidden compartment—invisible to casual inspection. Something valuable was stored here and removed at some point.",
    "explorer": "The base is engineered for concealment. Press along the seams at the bottom—there's likely a hidden compartment. If it's empty now, whatever was stored here was removed deliberately. Check the mansion's records around 1925-1926 for any mentions of vase restoration or appraisals—that might indicate when it was accessed. This vase held something valuable enough to commission special engineering."
