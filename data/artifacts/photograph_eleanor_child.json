  "type": "Personal Photograph - Family Record",
  "location": "With Dressmaker character (found among Elias Monroe's possessions)",
  "description": "A black and white photograph of a young child playing in a garden, wearing simple white dress with bow.",
  "character_interpretations": {
    "dressmaker": "Eleanor as a young child, years after the infant photograph. The fact that a second photograph was sent suggests ongoing contact between the families. My ancestor kept both photographs hidden—proof that he knew the truth about Eleanor and maintained awareness of Cordelia's daughter as she grew.",
    "explorer": "The garden setting matches 1920s Long Beach residential properties. This is a second photograph in a coordinated sequence. Find: 1) Who took these photographs and how they reached Elias Monroe, 2) Any letters or correspondence accompanying the photographs, 3) The Sullivan family property records (the garden should help identify the house). This is evidence of deliberate, planned communication across separated families. Someone was documenting Eleanor's development and ensuring Cordelia (and Elias) knew about it."
