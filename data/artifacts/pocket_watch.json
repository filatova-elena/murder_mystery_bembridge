    "clockmaker": "This is a remarkable piece. Gold-plated brass with excellent mechanisms. The interior inscription reads 'September 4, 1925 - 6:14 AM' with astronomical symbols around the numerals—a Jupiter-Venus conjunction. Whoever engraved this understood celestial alignments deeply. This wasn't just an engagement present. It's a record of a specific astronomical moment deemed important enough to carry always. The precision of the time suggests deliberate calculation, not coincidence.",
    "explorer": "September 4, 1925 at 6:14 AM—a documented Jupiter-Venus conjunction. This is a deliberate timestamp. Check Sebastian's notebooks and Thaddeus's records for references to this date and time. Something significant happened at this exact moment—a ritual, a beginning of something, or a record of a crucial event. This watch is a starting point marker. Find what Sebastian or Thaddeus were doing at 6:14 AM on September 4, 1925."
