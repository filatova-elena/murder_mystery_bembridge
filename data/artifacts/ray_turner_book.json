  "type": "Published Book - Art Retrospective / Coffee Table Book",
  "location": "With Art Collector character (Romano family holdings / personal library)",
  "description": "A beautifully produced retrospective documenting paintings from the 1920s-1930s, featuring color photographs and scholarly essays with handwritten annotations in the margins.",
  "character_interpretations": {
    "art_collector": "Someone used this book to leave deliberate clues. Handwritten annotations appear throughout the pages—repeated references to vessels and what they might contain. One annotation simply reads 'beauty hides secrets' with an arrow pointing to a particular painting. The recurring theme across the marginalia is concealment. 'What appears empty may hold everything.' These notes reference specific paintings, particularly the Italian diptych. Someone was studying these paintings, looking for something hidden in plain sight.",
    "explorer": "Ray Turner was documenting smuggling operations through coded annotations. 'Vessels,' 'containment,' 'beauty hides secrets'—all literal references to how contraband was moved. Find: 1) Ray Turner's personal papers and correspondence, 2) All his annotations in this book—create a full list of paintings he marked and his notes about each, 3) Whether Turner was connected to the Romano family or law enforcement. These annotations are a roadmap of the smuggling operation. Pay special attention to paintings that weren't recovered or relocated. Turner might be pointing you to hidden valuables or evidence."
