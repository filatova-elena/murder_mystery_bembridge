    "heiress": "The rose garden has always been beautiful, but I've recently learned it holds secrets. My ancestor allowed it to be used as a storage location by someone connected to the smuggling operations. I wonder what lies beneath the soil.",
    "explorer": "The hand-drawn map points here. Use the paced measurements from the map as your guide to find the exact location. Check: 1) Soil composition for disturbance layers, 2) Subsurface structures (check for buried containers, boxes, or vaults), 3) Garden maintenance records (when was the soil last turned, re-seeded, or disturbed?). Rose gardens' disturbed soil is easily explained as 'gardening.' Multiple burial/retrieval cycles are evident. Bring digging equipment and investigate below the surface where the map indicates."
