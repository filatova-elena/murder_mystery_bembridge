    "baker": "There's a plant that grows in the garden, tall with purple and white spotted flowers. Pretty, really. I've seen it around estate gardens. But I'd never use it in cooking—I know from intuition it's dangerous. Something about it just feels... wrong.",
    "heiress": "There are plants all over this estate I've never bothered to identify. Some are quite beautiful, honestly. That tall purple-flowered one with the spotted throats is striking. I should ask the gardener what it's called.",
