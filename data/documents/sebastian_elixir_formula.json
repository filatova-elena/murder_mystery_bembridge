    "professor": "Damiana is a tropical shrub with that distinctive minty, slightly bitter flavor. Valerian has that characteristic earthy, musty aroma. Ginseng, damiana, valerian, rose otto—all legitimate botanical specimens I've studied extensively. Someone consulted my ancestor Edmund Hartley about precisely these plants. The ginseng is the most interesting: it's the rarest and most expensive ingredient here. Three parts damiana and two parts valerian create a base, but the ginseng root as a 'binding agent'? That's not traditional botanical use. Someone was experimenting with something new, something intentional. The proportions show mathematical thinking, not folk remedy guessing. In the 1920s, damiana was widely sold as a tonic for vitality and desire—every apothecary stocked it. Valerian was prescribed for nervousness and insomnia; my own textbooks recommended it. The combination is interesting because they work in opposition: damiana excites and awakens, while valerian calms and grounds. Someone understood this paradox intentionally. Rose otto was—and remains—associated with romantic love across Eastern and Western traditions, though its actual effects are primarily aromatic and psychological. Ginseng's reputation as a binding agent for longevity dates back centuries in Chinese medicine, but using it here as a 'binding agent for eternal love' suggests mystical thinking rather than botanical science. The pharmaceutical components reinforce this: potassium bromide doses were common enough in the 1920s that people took it without fear, though overuse could cause serious problems. The formula as a whole? It would create a liquid that tastes pleasant enough, induces mild relaxation through the bromide and valerian, and leaves the drinker susceptible to suggestion through the powerfully aromatic rose otto and the expectation of love. The effect would be primarily psychological—a beautiful ritual disguised as a medicinal elixir. But psychology itself is powerful. If someone believed they were drinking a potion of eternal love, that belief alone might change their behavior, their openness, their willingness to trust. That may have been the entire point.",
    "doctor": "The pharmaceutical compounds here are concerning. Potassium bromide at 10 grains—that's a standard sedative dosage. Calcium lactate and iron citrate are fortifying agents, nothing dangerous individually. But combined with this botanical mixture? And stored in an unstable environment? Each compound by itself is safe, even beneficial. But potassium bromide interacts with certain plant alkaloids. If someone miscalculated the interactions, or if the storage failed and concentrations changed... The 8 ounces of grain alcohol at 95% proof would dissolve everything perfectly. But it also accelerates degradation of certain compounds. This wasn't prepared by someone with proper pharmaceutical training.",
    "art_collector": "Harbor Import & Trading Co. sourced nearly everything botanical here—damiana, rose otto, ginseng. That's my family's company. That was Frankie's operation during Prohibition. On the surface, it was a legitimate import business. But any botanicals coming through that company in the 1920s? They came with questions attached. Rose otto is one of the most costly oils in the world—one drop represents significant expense. Ginseng with that distinctive forked, human-like shape—extremely precious. Someone was working through my family's network to obtain these precious ingredients—especially that rose otto and ginseng. The quantities are small, refined, expensive. This wasn't criminal work. This was someone with taste and resources, willing to access exclusive suppliers. Someone who understood how to work with the underworld to obtain legitimacy.",
    "explorer": "The historical sourcing pattern here is fascinating. Pacific Chemical Supply, Western Drug Wholesale, Turner & Sons Provisions, Riverside Apiary—all standard suppliers. But Harbor Import & Trading Co. appears for the most expensive, most specialized ingredients. Ginseng, rose otto, damiana, valerian—the exotics. This is a methodical supply chain built over time, using multiple sources to avoid suspicion. The pharmaceutical items are domestic. The botanical items go through the harbor import system. Someone understood supply chains intimately and built this network with precision. This took months or years of careful sourcing, not overnight improvisation.",
    "fiduciary": "The financial structure of this formula is revealing. The ingredient list shows diverse sourcing: domestic pharmaceutical suppliers, established herb merchants, an import company. The costs would be substantial—premium rose otto alone is extremely expensive, ginseng even more so. Eight ounces of 95% proof grain alcohol during Prohibition represents significant expense and risk. The total investment in all ingredients would exceed what most people could spend on a hobby project. This required resources, access to credit, and connections to suppliers. Someone with means created this. The fact that everything was documented through purchase records suggests careful record-keeping, not criminal concealment.",
    "baker": "The flavorings in this formula show someone who understood taste balance perfectly. Vanilla extract provides aromatic quality, cherry syrup with its tart sweetness would balance the bitter herbals, and honey—five pounds total—would round everything out with smoothness and preservation. The combination of vanilla, cherry, and honey would completely mask the bitter botanicals. Someone knew how to make something taste delicious while hiding its true nature."
