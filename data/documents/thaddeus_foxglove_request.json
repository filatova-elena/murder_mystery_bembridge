  "condition": "Faded ink, creased, appears to have been crumpled and smoothed out",
  "content": "Sebastian - need more concentrated foxglove extract for my cardiac cases. Can you prepare another batch? - Thaddeus",
  "reveals": "A routine request from Dr. Thaddeus to his brother Sebastian for pharmaceutical preparation. Foxglove extract was a standard cardiac medicine in the 1920s.",
  "character_interpretations": {
    "professor": "Foxglove extract—Digitalis purpurea. It's toxic in high concentrations, but it has legitimate cardiac applications. The compound was commonly prescribed for heart conditions in the 1920s. A doctor requesting it from a pharmacist is entirely normal.",
    "fiduciary": "A straightforward pharmaceutical request. Foxglove was a standard cardiac medicine during this era—widely used and perfectly legal, but it is a know toxin.",
    "clockmaker": "A request dated September 1, 1925. That's interesting—I have a pocket watch engraved with September 4, 1925. Same year, just days apart. Dates like this stand out to someone in my line of work.",
    "baker": "A note between brothers about medicine. Not my area of expertise."
